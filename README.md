`$ npm install`

`$ npx playwright test --workers=1`


Improvements:

- Make cross browser runs more stable

- Add visual testing

- Creating a new user or project through the UI for each scenario is not ideal - Aternative could be create seeded data for the pre-conditions directly through the relevant API endpoints
